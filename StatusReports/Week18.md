# Status Report Week 18
## What has been done
Report - Finished writing the theoretic background but I'm probably going to cut back om some sections about rust. Wrote design implementation and did tests about effect on compile time when using docker containers. The result is presented in box and wiskers graphs. I planning on opposing Klas.

## Plan for next week
Implementation - Not much left to do.

Report - Just keep on working.

## Not achieved/dropped
Nothing
