# Status Report Week 4
## What has been done
I've worked a lot on the background. During the meeting on Monday I got a clear picture of the task of thesis so I stripped a lot from my notes and narrowed it to specially fit the goal of the thesis. Me and Klas has started discussing the rust AST representation, how to ensure static type-checking by Scala and also avoid ambiguity with assigned variables. The AST should be designed to allow as much validity checking as possible of the semantics and also avoid ambiguity. The semantics of the AST should be easily understandable for the user. It should also be easy to extend, since this will be a prototype, and it should not restrict the user by not exposing rust language features.
I only briefly touched Scala, looked into generic types and traits, and how they can be used for static type-checking of the AST.

## Plan for next week
The main plan for next week is continuing with the background research and preparing the presentation for the background meeting.

## Not achieved/dropped
Not as much Scala this week as I planed.
