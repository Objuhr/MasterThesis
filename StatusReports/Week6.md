# Status Report Week 6
## What has been done
I've done a background presentation, which took about half the week to prepare. The rest of the week I have expanded the background study and transferred my notes into the LaTeX template.

## Plan for next week
Continue implementing the AST representation, incorporate a small amount of virtualization into the structure. For the thesis report, I want to write the background section about Scala and potentially start writing about the design decisions made for this thesis. 

## Not achieved/dropped
Nothing
