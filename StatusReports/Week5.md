# Status Report Week 5
## What has been done
I've read about the expression problem and modular development of an interpreter in Scala. I've prepared the presentation for the next week and made a small prototype of the AST and the interpreter where the AST can be partially type-checked.

## Plan for next week
The presentation is on wednesday so most of next week will be preparation for that. After the meeting I will know if the proposed idea needs adjustment and I can start just writing the report and transfere the notes on background.

## Not achieved/dropped
Nothing
