# Status Report Week 14
## What has been done
Implementation - Started to combine our work. Looked into dynamically loading both Rust stdlib, C stdlib and other rust libraries to reduce task binary sizes.

Report - Expanded on the theoretic background, written most of the design and started on implementation and evaluation & discussion.

## Plan for next week
Implementation - Write tests to evaluate performance of dynamically linking libraries.

Report - Just keep on working.

## Not achieved/dropped
Nothing
