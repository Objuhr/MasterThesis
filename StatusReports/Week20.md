# Status Report Week 20
## What has been done
Report - Written more on the design and implementation. Moved a docker part from introduction to background. Future work has been added. I've received my opposer's report so a lot of the work this week has been opposing.

## Plan for next week
Implementation - Not much left to do.

Report - Just keep on working, starts to feel ready. I will have to finish my opposition which will take some time.

## Not achieved/dropped
Nothing
