# Status Report Week 7
## What has been done
I have expanded the background section of the thesis report. I have mainly dug into the tag problem and how it relates to CDA and the Rust AST and how to implement the AST. I've also started to implement a Scala AST which should be modular to extend. Me and Klas have been talking how the ast should be formed and user.

## Plan for next week
Implementing the nodes which is my responsibility in AST, makeing sure that they generate correct rust code.

## Not achieved/dropped
I have not yet started writing about either Scala or the design decisions made in the thesis. The design decisions will have to wait until they are actually materialized.
