# Status Report Week 12
## What has been done
Implementation - I've been working on complete static linking of binaries, meaning linking of libc and other c tools and comparing it to dynamically link it which could be done by setting up the correct run-time environment with docker on workers.

Report - the introduction is done apart from some retouching I’m going to do at the end. I've written more on the theoretic background and started writing design and implementation.

## Plan for next week
Implementation - Not much, look at the impact on size of binaries by making the binaries stand-alone and fully statically link everything. I would also like to try to run apps which dynamically link tools in docker.

Report - Continue on the theoretic background and explain the design decisions better.

## Not achieved/dropped
Nothing
